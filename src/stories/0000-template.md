# 0000-Template

*This is a template for adding a new story. To propose a new stories PR, do the following:*

* *Create a new file in the `stories` directory named something like `0000-alan-tries-to-foo.md` or `0000-grace-does-bar.md`, and start from [the raw source from this template]. You can replace all the italicized stuff. :)*
* *Do not add a link to your story to the [`SUMMARY.md`] file; we'll do it after merging, otherwise there will be too many conflicts.*

*If you're looking for ideas of what to write about, take a look at the [open issues]. You can also [open an issue of your own] to throw out an idea for others.*
